# Real Estate Market Analysis

This project conducts an in-depth analysis of the real estate market using a dataset of housing listings in Canada. The dataset includes information such as property prices, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location details, and median family income.

## Data Exploration and Cleaning

The project begins with data exploration to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. Initial steps include:

1. Importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.
2. Loading the dataset from a CSV file and examining its contents.
3. Checking for missing values and updating data types as needed.
4. Cleaning the data by removing irrelevant columns and filtering out unrealistic values, such as extreme numbers of bedrooms.

## Market Analysis

The analysis focuses on exploring patterns and trends in the real estate market, including:

1.Analyzing housing prices based on cities and provinces, comparing them to median family income.
2.Visualizing the top expensive cities and provinces in Canada.
3.Identifying any correlations between housing prices, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other parameters.

## Results and Insights

Key findings from the analysis include:

1.The most expensive cities in Canada, such as White Rock, Vancouver, and Maple Ridge.
2.Provinces with the highest median family income, including Caledon and Airdine.
3.Minimal correlation between parameters, with the only significant correlation found between the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the real estate market in Canada. Despite minimal correlation between parameters, understanding regional trends and pricing factors can inform stakeholders in the real estate industry, policymakers, and potential buyers or investors.
